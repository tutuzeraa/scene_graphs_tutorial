## Initializing the submodules

After clonning the repository, run the following commands to initalize and clone the submodules:

```bash
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

## Environment setup

For this environment setup, we use [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). To install micromamba, you can follow the installation guide [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html).

Then, create a new environment based on a YAML file description, like:

```bash
$ micromamba create -f base_environment.yaml
```
